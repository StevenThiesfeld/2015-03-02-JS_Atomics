  <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>
  <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p> as with gets in ruby, the incoming input is a string, even if the user enters only numbers</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
  <p>Empty String, nothing more nothing less(unless they click cancel, then it returns null)</p>
  
  <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2> 
  <p>I named my variable names as descriptive as possible ( and slightly short-handed)</p>
