  <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>
  <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p> as with gets in ruby, the incoming input is a string, even if the user enters only numbers</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
  <p>Empty String, nothing more nothing less(unless they click cancel, then it returns null)</p>
  
  <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2> 
  <p>I named my variable names as descriptive as possible ( and slightly short-handed)</p>
  
  <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
  
  <p>It would make sense to keep the variables as closely related to it's corresponding question as possible</p>
  
  <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
  <p>Most websites use forms for gathering input from a user, they are better in my eyes to being less obstructive than the popup a prompt() creates, but there might be an advantage in gathering information before a page actually loads (which is what prompt() does I think)</p>
  
  <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
  <p>Research shows that you can't have two input fields natively in a single prompt() popup</p>
  
  <h2>	What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>No questions on this subject</p>
