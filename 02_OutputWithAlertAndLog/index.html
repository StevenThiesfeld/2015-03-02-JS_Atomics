  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>
  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>alert() creates a popup window with the supplied parameter that is readily
    visible to the user, while a console.log() prints out the parameter to the command line of the javascript console, which isn't readily apparent to the average user </p>
    
  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an alert() to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>One common example I can think of is warning a user that a link they clicked will take them to a new website.  Another example might be a popup explaining the rules of a game, or announcing a winner.</p>
  
  <h2>What's one way that alert() might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>Overuse seems like the most likely source of frustration from the user, as well as obstructing the main webpage</p>
  
  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>The Javascript console is the only way to see console.log() output, so it seems to be more of a developer tool than a method of communication to the user</p>
  
  <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>It seems like it will function as a debugging tool for doing things like checking variable values, conditional paths and other things that pry is used for in ruby</p>
  
  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>In my current JS file the alert() is triggered first, and halts all further code until the user closes the popup, then the console.log() commands will be displayed in the JS console.  Finally the farewell alert() will trigger.  I learned this by refreshing the page and paying attention to what showed up on the Console and when.</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>The only question I have is am I correct in theorizing that the console.log() output will fill a role similar to binding.pry?</p>
