  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
  <p>no flexability, even with == it's case sensative</p>
  <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
  <p>I used === because the others are less strict about comparing types</p>
  <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file? (Hint: there are at least two reasons)</h2>
  <p>you can see the javascript used in the page with the console, and when the user enters the password it is easily visible</p>
